This is a test file.
My name is Harry.
And I come from China.
I am 30 years old.
Nice to meet you too.

Yeah, a thousand miles I'd walk just to see you
A thousand miles I'd walk
A thousand miles I'd walk just to see you
A thousand miles I'd walk
And every time you're not around I feel lost
Tell me what's wrong
Tell me if you're broken, what's the cause?
You'll hear about it in a song
Why do you even care, like, God?
Say do you even know how much you mean to me?
